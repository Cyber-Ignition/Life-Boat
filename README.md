# Life-Boat
A medicine-based full-stack web application developed using MERN, it adheres to the user's request by providing valuable medical information about a particular medicine/drug/pharmaceutical product by fetching data from OpenFDA API and MediaWiki API. The user can also order a product by adding it to their cart or cancel an order anytime. There is scope for User Registration/Sign in which implements authentication using JsonWebToken as well as authorization for data security. Development of this app is still under progress. Here are some screenshots of the pages.
